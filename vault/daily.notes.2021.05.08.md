## Notes

- [ ] A great video course on getting using Svelte. Loads of great
      tips and yet easy to understand. I've watched it through and
      love it! @JesseSkinner knows his onions and I'm happy to pay for
      this! https://www.joyofsvelte.com/

- [x] When I first started learning web development I got really
      bogged down in the tooling.
