## Notes

- [ ] Notes on How To Remember Everything You Learn
  - [ ] spaced repetition is key
  - [ ] Some great quotes from Dr. Barbara Oakley -- Learning How to
        Learn for Illusions of Competence
    - [ ] seeing the information in front you, such as reading a book,
          doesn't mean you know it.
    - [ ] seeing or hearing someone come to a conclusion doesn't mean
          you know how they get to that conclusion or explain their
          argument.
    - [ ] searching for something on Google gives you the illusion
          that the information is in your brain.
    - [ ] spending lots of time with material doesn't mean you know
          it.
  - [ ] The person who says they know what they think but cannot
        express it usually do not know what they think. -- Mortimer
        Adler (Philosopher)
  - [ ] To regard anyone except yourself as responsible for your
        judgment is to be a slave, not a free man. -- Mortimer Adler
        (Philosopher)
  - [ ] I don't want to be a mindless consumer of data
  - [ ] spaced repetition
    - [ ] the brain is like a muscle, it needs to be flexed often
    - [ ] the more often you do the thing you want to commit to memory
          the better your understanding of that thing will stick in
          your memory.
    - [ ] you don't need to memorise everything that comes your way,
          that's impossible
  - [ ] to recognise the limits of your knowledge and to appreciate
        others' intellectual strengths is one of the best things you
        can do.
  - [ ] it's in our nature to focus on how we were wrong rather than
        we're now smarter. Attaching our egos to what we believe is
        determental to growing. A view is how you see something, it
        doesn't define you.
