        Learn for Illusions of Competence
    - [ ] seeing the information in front you, such as reading a book,
          doesn't mean you know it.

          you know how they get to that conclusion or explain their
          argument.
    - [ ] searching for something on Google gives you the illusion
          that the information is in your brain.
    - [ ] spending lots of time with material doesn't mean you know
          it.
  - [ ] The person who says they know what they think but cannot
        express it usually do not know what they think. -- Mortimer
        Adler (Philosopher)
