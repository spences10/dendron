## Window management

You can move the current window around the screen with a combination
of the Windows key and the arrow keys.

Holding down the `Windows key+right` with move the current window to
the right hand half of the screen.

To further reduce the size of the current window using the
`Windows key+down` will move the window into the bottom right corner
taking up a quarter of the screen.

## Open Windows PowerShell as admin

There's a few tasks that always need me top open Windows PowerShell as
admin, this usually involves opening the Windows menu then searching
for PowerShell and right clicking to open as administrator.

The shortcut key `Windows key+x` opens the quicklinks menu, from there
all you need to do is press `a` to open PowerShell as admin.

## Open the notifications tray

`Windows key+a` will open recent notifications.
