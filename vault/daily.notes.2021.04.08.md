## Notes

- Trello: Cool kanban board, ok for managing projects. Everything
  stays in the tab for that task, no markdown support.

- Notion: Hey look I can do everything! Import your Trello, Evernote,
  Confluence projects here, sure np. You're golden as long as you have
  an internet connection and don't plan on using the markdown from
  there anywhere else

- Roam Research: "Join our cult" No thanks! Web interface was weird to
  get around linking took a really long time and the knowledge graph
  took an age to render. Again it's Markdown but everything needs to
  be a bullet (because bullet journal!) breaking out to just write
  Markdown was a pain.

- Obsidian: Super nice interface with themes and shortcut keys, local
  storage, not online, great knowledge graph visualisation ðŸ”¥ It's
  another application to manage and open, Markdown is Markdown and
  transferable to text editors with no issues.

- Foam: Everything from Roam Research and Obsidian in VS Code via
  extensions, awesome knowledge graph visualisation. Use your
  preferred text editor (VS Code) use all the keyboard shortcuts for
  editing you are accustomed to in and environment you spend a lot of
  your time (being a web developer).

- Dendron: Flat file structure, awesome search functionality baked
  into it, publishable as a 11ty site with search. Meh knowledge graph
  visualisation, keyboard shortcuts interfere when not in a Dendron
  workspace
