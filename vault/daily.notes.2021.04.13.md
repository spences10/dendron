## Notes

- @mlukaszczyk and @daniel first - they're the Co-Founders and very
  open to talking about the company, the vision, and the product.
  Reach out to say hi or get anything clarified, they're super
  approachable.
- @Chris is the CCO, and in charge of everything commercial.
- @ronak heading up the Marketing team, alongside @notrab who’s
  looking into everything Developer Relations.
- @alex, @John, and @Michael Bee head up Direct Sales, Partnerships,
  and Customer Success respectively.
- @fabian is the brain of the company - jumping in between all things
  in Product and Support.
- On the dev side @Frederik Eychenié is the man behind the Frontend
  team, @Pablo heads up the Backend team, and @Marcos Pasqualino is
  the one in charge of our infrastructure.
