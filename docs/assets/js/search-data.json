things currently.\n\n## There was two approaches\n\nThere was two approaches to getting the data to SendGrid, the first\none was with a SendGrid form and pulling the API key from the POST.\n\nThe second approach was to put directly from the sign-up form to the\nSendGrid API with a PUT request.\n\nThis was all Sam so massive thanks to him for walking me through this!\n\nHere's an example of the request:\n\n```js\nexport default async function putToSendGrid(email, name) {\n  await fetch('https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/contacts', {\n    method: 'PUT',\n    headers: {\n

Data Fetching\n\nRuns at build time: `getStaticProps` (Static Generation): Fetch data\nat **build time**.\n\nRuns on render: `getStaticPaths` (Static Generation): Specify dynamic\nroutes to pre-render based on data.\n\nRuns on refresh: `getServerSideProps` (Server-side Rendering): Fetch\ndata on each request.\n\n## Example of having nested routes\n\nThis is for when you want to have dynamic routes that are more than a\n`posts/[slug].js` path, so what do I mean by that, lets take a look at\nthe typical file structure on the Next.js example sites:\n\n```text\nnext-js-project/\n├─ content/\n│  ├─ post-one.md\n│  ├─ post-two.md\n│  └─ post-three.md\n├─ pages/\n│  ├─ posts/[slug].js\n│  └─ index.js\n```\n\nThat will give you the path to the files like:\n\n```text\nlocalhost:3000/posts/post-one\nlocalhost:3000/posts/ost-two\nlocalhost:3000/posts/post-three\n```\n\nThat's fine n' all but what if you have content you want to link with\nyour Markdown posts like images, that content folder will get a bit\ndifficult to reason about once you get a lot of content in there.\n\nWith Gatsby I have always done a file structure in this format:\n\n```text\ncontent/posts/yyyy/mm/dd/post-title/index.mdx\n```\n\nSo I went about trying to do that with the Next.js examples.\n\nThanks to [Eka] in the Party Corgi Discord for pointing out the\nsection in the [basic features] of the Next.js documentation, it\nwasn't entirely clear to me what **catch all routes** was.\n\n:`lib/posts.js`\n\n```js\nimport globby from 'globby'\n\nconst postsDirectory = './content/posts'\n\nexport async function getPostPaths() {\n  const files = await globby(postsDirectory, {\n    expandDirectories: { extensions: ['md*'] },\n  })\n\n  return await files\n}\n\nexport async function getPostSlugs() {\n  const files = await getPostPaths()\n\n  const paths = files.map(path => {\n    const split = path.split(`/`)\n    // remove `content/posts` and `index.md*`\n    const removedIndexFile = split.splice(2, split.length - 3)\n\n    return {\n      params: {\n        slug: removedIndexFile,\n      },\n    }\n  })\n\n  return {\n    paths,\n    fa,\n  }\n}\n```\n\n:`pages/[...slug].js`\n\n```js\nimport { getPostSlugs } from '../lib/posts'\n\nexport default function Post({ slug }) {\n  console.log('=====================')\n  console.log(`slug::: ${slug}`)\n  console.log('=====================')\n  return <Layout>yo</Layout>\n}\n\nexport const getStaticPaths = async () => {\n  return await getPostSlugs()\n}\n\nexport const
